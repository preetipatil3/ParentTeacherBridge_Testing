# Real-Time Features Implementation

## Overview
This educational admin dashboard now includes real-time updates that reflect changes immediately without requiring page reloads. All changes are synchronized across components and pages.

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time State Management**
- **Context Provider**: Uses React Context API for global state management
- **Data Synchronization**: All data is synchronized across all components
- **Immediate Updates**: Changes are reflected instantly across the entire application

### 2. **Toast Notifications**
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation when items are added, updated, or deleted
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users get immediate feedback for their actions
- **Auto-Dismiss**: Notifications automatically disappear after 3 seconds
- **Manual Dismiss**: Users can manually close notifications

### 3. **Live Statistics Dashboard**
- **Real-Time Counts**: Shows live counts of teachers, classes, students, and schedules
- **Active Status**: Displays active vs total counts
- **Average Calculations**: Real-time calculation of average class sizes
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh with confirmation toast

## Implementation Details

### Context Providers
```jsx
// DataContext.jsx - Manages all application data
const DataProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [teachers, setTeachers] = useState([...]);
  const [classes, setClasses] = useState([...]);
  const [students, setStudents] = useState([...]);
  // ... more state

  // Real-time update functions
  const deleteTeacher = (id) => {
    setTeachers(teachers.filter(teacher => teacher.id !== id));
    showToast(`Teacher "${teacher?.name}" deleted successfully`, 'success');
  };
};
```

### Toast Notifications
```jsx
// ToastContext.jsx - Manages notifications
const showToast = (message, type = 'success') => {
  const id = Date.now();
  const newToast = { id, message, type, timestamp: new Date() };
  setToasts(prev => [...prev, newToast]);
  
  // Auto remove after 3 seconds
  setTimeout(() => removeToast(id), 3000);
};
```

### Component Integration
```jsx
// TeacherManagement.jsx - Example of real-time integration
const TeacherManagement = () => {
  const { teachers, deleteTeacher, updateTeacher } = useData();
  const { showToast } = useToast();

  const handleDelete = (id) => {
    deleteTeacher(id); // This triggers real-time update and toast
  };
};
```
